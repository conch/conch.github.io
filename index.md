I'm a software engineer at [Roche](http://www.roche.com){:target='_blank'} in a new internal startup team that's creating a platform for oncologists to make quicker and better informed decisions about their patients.

Before that, I was at [Evernote](https://evernote.com){:target='_blank'}. I was the tech lead/lone developer of the [Web Clipper](https://evernote.com/webclipper){:target='_blank'} for a few years, before transitioning to the commerce team, where I worked on payment systems and monetization. Previously, I studied computer science and engineering at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://mit.edu){:target='_blank'}. In addition to studying, I practiced my craft at a variety of places, from tiny startups ([Surf Canyon](http://surfcanyon.com){:target='_blank'}, Pipewise) to medium-sized startups ([Ooyala](http://www.ooyala.com/){:target='_blank'}) to large corporations ([IBM](https://www.ibm.com){:target='_blank'}) and university labs ([MIT Media Lab](http://hd.media.mit.edu/){:target='_blank'}, [Université catholique de Louvain](http://sites.uclouvain.be/networks/){:target='_blank'}). See my [résumé](resume.pdf) for more details.

Outside of work, I enjoy knitting and woodworking. I also enjoy travel and photography, often together.
